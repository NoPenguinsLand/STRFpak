# STRFpak
Generate spectro-temporal receptive field.
I updated STRFPak to ensure compatibility with Matlab R2017b.

Original description here: http://strfpak.berkeley.edu/
"STRFPak is a Matlab toolbox for estimating the linear and nonlinear stimulus-response mapping function of sensory systems. This mapping function is commonly called the spatio- or spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF). A quantitative estimate of the STRF can be used in subsequent computational modeling studies or to predict future responses of the system. STRFPak implements several general STRF estimation techniques and can be used with any stimuli (including natural scenes and sounds)."
